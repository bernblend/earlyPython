# Once again, say_hello is a function (AKA procedure). But this time, it DOESN'T
# do the same thing every time.

# Read through the code and try to predict what the output will be when
# you press "Test Run"

# In the previous example, you saw code that looked like what you see above.
# Look at the first line. In that line, 'name' is a "parameter"
# of the function say_hello

# In the code below, the add_two_numbers function has two parameters.
# What do you think will happen when you press "Test Run"?
# Make a prediction and then press "Test Run"

# Once you've pressed Test Run, remove the comment characters from the
# code below and then make ONE modification so that the function does
# what the name says it should do.

#    return number_1 + number_2

#print subtract_two_numbers(4, 3)

#This example shows that the function sum returns no value.
#OUTPUT: None (no value)
def sum(a, b):
    a = a + b

print sum(1, 1)

#Here we add print statements to debug the code.

    a = a + b
